- collision with particular wall is broken
- other walls work mostly, but have same core issue
- where collision is checked several times? what
- fix by copying the code from my other project lol

- intel integrated graphics doesnt have hole in wall, nvidia does
- epsilon value when writing vertex buffer

- when rendering bound framebuffer, would always clear texture unit 0
- learned i have to use glClearBuffer instead
- wrong param to glFramebufferTexture2D (fbo instead of texture name)
