- collision with particular wall is broken
- other walls work mostly, but have same core issue
- where collision is checked several times? what
- fix by copying the code from my other project lol

# 2025-09-02
- intel integrated graphics doesnt have hole in wall, nvidia does
- epsilon value when writing vertex buffer

# 2025-09-20
- when rendering bound framebuffer, would always clear texture unit 0
- learned i have to use glClearBuffer instead
- wrong param to glFramebufferTexture2D (fbo instead of texture name)

# 2025-10-02
- getting pixels doesnt work in texture unit query
- works if texture is window width and height
- have to make sure glTexImage2D width is aligned to GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT

# 2025-10-04
- resizing window changes texture unit in minimap framebuffer

- purple screen of death when tilt, couldn't reproduce
- wall buffer accessing out of bounds

# 2025-12-20
- parjicle and particle were not rendering
- using z instead of y when updating buffer

# 2026-2-12
- game froze, probably because of uninitialized data somewhere causing infinite loop

# 2026-2-13
- using glBufferSubData(buffer 1, offset 4, size 4) to update a GL_STATIC_DRAW buffer
- resize window

# 2026-2-17
- font rendering had weird spacing
- fix was just using the api correctly
- real fix was using floats for calculation and flooring left side bearing

# 2026-2-17
- centering text has issues with monospace font
- no issues when left aligned, so problem is probably rounding error 

# 2026-2-24
- tile was raised only in shaitan
