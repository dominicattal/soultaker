- collision with particular wall is broken
- other walls work mostly, but have same core issue
- where collision is checked several times? what
- fix by copying the code from my other project lol

- intel integrated graphics doesnt have hole in wall, nvidia does
- epsilon value when writing vertex buffer

- when rendering bound framebuffer, would always clear texture unit 0
- learned i have to use glClearBuffer instead
- wrong param to glFramebufferTexture2D (fbo instead of texture name)

# 2025-10-02
- getting pixels doesnt work in texture unit query
- works if texture is window width and height
- have to make sure glTexImage2D width is aligned to GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT

- resizing window changes texture unit in minimap framebuffer

- purple screen of death when tilt, couldn't reproduce
- wall buffer accessing out of bounds
